  I’m Sam Rodrigues, also know online as androidWG. I make many things but mostly music, apps, websites and UI/UX designs. You can find almost all of my recent work on this website.


  Brazilian born but living in Montréal, Canada since February 2022, I’ve been programming since 2013, designing since 2018 and making music since 2020. I love using my projects to learn new technologies, techniques, platforms, and of course ideas, and my overall work extends to many more projects that didn’t pass the trial phase.
